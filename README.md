# GLOBAL-TERRORISM-ANALYSIS
EDA

Content:
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland. In this project, we are going to analyze Global Terrorism Data to find out valuable insights.

Steps involved in doing this project
Data cleaning:- Data cleaning is an important step in the data analytics process in which you either remove or update information that is incomplete or improperly formatted. Fields like eventid, approxdate, resolution, addnotes, extended, etc. are removed since they are not relevant to the analysis of this project. Fields like Nan values were handled by replacing Nan values with workable ones.

Exploratory Data Analysis:- In this step, we explored the data by understanding it and doing some computations over it, and creating relevant data frames to be able to plot them into graphs for visualization purposes.

Data Visualization:- This is the most important step in which we created graphs to see the results visually and made them end user-ready. This step also helps us to make conclusions out of the explored data as we have stated below.

Conclusion
1. Year 2014 had the most number of terror attacks overall. Approximately 17000 attacks in one year. This means that around 47 attacks were happening every single day during that year in multiple locations around the world.
